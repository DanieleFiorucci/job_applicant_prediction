**Job Applicant Prediction**

Welcome to the Job Applicant Prediction repository! In this project, our objective is to predict whether an applicant will successfully obtain a job based on input data from two datasets: one containing applicant information and the other containing details about the desired position. The code in this repository includes the initial merging of the two datasets, exploratory data analysis, feature selection, data cleaning, preprocessing, and model building.

**Background**

This project was developed as part of a hackathon and was completed within a tight timeframe of less than 24 hours. Despite the time constraints, our team managed to deliver a winning solution by employing efficient coding practices and leveraging powerful machine learning techniques.
